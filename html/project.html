    <h3>“AI-BASED FAKE JOB POST DETECTION USING RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM”</h3>
    <hr id="one">

        <pre>
            The proliferation of online job boards has led to a surge in the number of fake job postings. Fake 
            job postings deceive job seekers by offering non-existent jobs or misrepresenting job descriptions. 
            This not only wastes time for job seekers but can also result in financial losses. In this project, 
            we propose a machine learning solution for the detection of fake job postings. The proposed system 
            uses a Random Forest algorithm to classify job postings as either genuine or fake. The system is 
            trained on a large dataset of real and fake job postings, and it achieves high accuracy in detecting 
            fake job postings.

            Keywords: Fake Job Post, Random Forest Classifier, Machine Learning, Legitimate Job, Decision Tree.
